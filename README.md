# Deep-Dive-Jenkins-Continuous-Integration

# Background
### In this project I integrate Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Nexus, and Slack in the Continuous Integration phase of a Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline.
### Continuous integration is a software development practice where members of a team use a version control system and frequently integrate their work to the same location, such as a main branch. Each change is built and verified to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Continuous integration is focused on automatically building and testing code, as compared to continuous delivery, which automates the entire software release process up to production.https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts-continuous-delivery-integration.html

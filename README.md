# Deep-Dive-Jenkins-Continuous-Integration

# Background
### In this project I integrate Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Nexus, and Slack in the Continuous Integration phase of a Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline.
### Continuous integration is a software development practice where members of a team use a version control system and frequently integrate their work to the same location, such as a main branch. Each change is built and verified to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Continuous integration is focused on automatically building and testing code, as compared to continuous delivery, which automates the entire software release process up to production.https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts-continuous-delivery-integration.html

# Step 1: Install Jenkins, Nexus, SonarQube

### a) Create an Amazon Linux 2 VM instance and call it "JenkinsServer"
#### - Instance type: t2.large
#### - Security Group (Open): 8080, 9100 and 22 to 0.0.0.0/0
#### - Key pair: Select or create a new keypair
#### - Attach Jenkins server with IAM role having "AdministratorAccess"
#### - User data (Copy the following user data): https://github.com/SheyNjila1/Deep-Dive-Jenkins-Continuous-Integration/blob/main/userdata/Jenkins.sh
#### - Launch Instance
#### - After launching this Jenkins server, attach a tag as Key=Application, value=jenkins

### b) Create an Create an Ubuntu 20.04 VM instance and call it "SonarQubeServer"
#### - Instance type: t2.medium
#### - Security Group (Open): 9000, 9100 and 22 to 0.0.0.0/0
